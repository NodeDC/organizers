# What does an organizer do?

Not every organizer needs to do everything, but here's what needs to happen to have a meetup.

## All the time

- Outreach!
- Find speakers
- Plan non-speaker-focused events

## Scheduling a meetup

- Secure a venue (currently, we are hosted by Social Tables; todo: link to a list of spaces with contact information)
- Secure a way to pay for food and beverages (currently, we have some sponsorship money :tada:)
- Announce the meetup on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/?action=new)
- Schedule \@NodeDC tweets

## Before a meetup

- Order food and beverages (currently, we have pizza delivered by Domino's and beverages delivered by Drizly)
- Submit attendee list to venue no later than Noon (this is a specific requirement of Building Security at Social Tables)
- Receive food and beverage delivery at the venue

## At a meetup

- Welcome attendees
- Before the talk:
  - Announcements
  - Thank the venue and any sponsors and ask attendees to tweet, mentioning any sponsors
  - Introduce the speaker
- During the talk:
  - Take a few photos of the speaker and attendees and tweet them, thanking any sponsors
- After the talk:
  - Thank the speaker
  - Ask attendees to help clean up and put away chairs
  - Invite everyone to convene at a nearby watering hole

## After a meetup

- `GOTO 10`
